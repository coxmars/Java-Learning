        // We put: javac -> NameClass.java always this is the first step the compilation and then the execution
        // To execute is: java -> NameClass without .java or something similar and we pass the parameters
        // IMPORTANT: All these processes are correct but the problem is execute apps in terminal, because we have to
        // change version of SDK
